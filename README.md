# Reed Geisler's Curriculum Vitae

This is a personal project, relying on JSONResume to build the design of my site at https://reedismy.name. Frontend construction and deployment kindly provided courtesy of Netlify.

As a personal reminder to myself: with each build, remember to require the excellent "Eloquent" theme, and after generating each build, apply minor stylistic changes to headings and other portions of the page in generated index.html appropriate to current desired build (may eventually troubleshoot local theme rendering faults with JSONResume's command line tool handling of handlebars (.hbs) files in local repository).

resume.json is the most up-to-date compendium of major experiences in my CV, with exception to minor or single-day experiences, removed as appropriate. Thanks again to all of the developers on JSONResume who made this hobby project possible!

Future goals for CV or future portfolio site:
* Consider alternative designs
* Expanded descriptions of each experience/award/publication
* Links to all publications, posters, presentations once generated and as appropriate
* * Dropdown/search functionality through sections, once experiences have grown lengthy enough to warrant it
